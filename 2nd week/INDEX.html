  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="sam"><div class = "span1">Chicken</div>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. </div></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="sam"><div class = "span1">Fish</div>Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.</div></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><div class="sam"><div class = "span1">Prawn</div> Part of the confusion originates with the association of smallness. That creates problems with shrimp-like species that are not small. The expression "jumbo shrimp" can be viewed as an oxymoron, a problem that doesn't exist with the commercial designation "jumbo prawns"</div></div>
